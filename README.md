# 👋 Hi, I'm Levan Mamulashvili  

🚀 **Tech Leader | Ex-CTO | AI/ML Enthusiast**  

For the past **7 years** I’ve been in **managerial roles** — from **Engineering Manager** to **CTO**, and now **Tribe Tech Lead at TBC Bank**.  

🏆 **Recognitions**  
- Forbes 30 Under 30 (Technology, 2024)  
- DORA Award (TBC Bank)  
- SAP Digital Excellence Award (Tegeta Holding)  
- MIT CXO Certification (CTO leadership focus)  

💡 **What drives me**  
Beyond leadership, I’m obsessed with **AI & ML** — building tools, analyzing code, and experimenting daily to improve **SDLC speed, quality, and delivery** in enterprise environments.  

⚙️ **How I work**  
- Began my career in **2013 as an iOS Engineer** — still my first love ❤️.  
- I frequently dive into the **Swift** and **Kotlin Multiplatform SDK** codebases of companies I work with, because I can’t imagine leadership without reading and modifying code at least once a week.  
- Heavy daily use of **Claude Code** with **MCP servers** (Context7, Exa.ai, Memory Bank, Playwright).  
- Actively develop **per-project LLMs**, mixing models like **Claude, OpenAI, Gemini**.  
- Build projects primarily with **React (Next.js)**, **Node.js + TypeScript**, and **Python**, while using **Redis, Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform** for managing scalability, infrastructure, and deployments.
